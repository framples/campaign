What do we WANT? MVP

1. Crazy vampire dad who is undying and sacrificing his bloodline to stay alive. 
2. 2 sons that he wants returned to him to butcher
3. Dead mother after finding the truth does daughter die as well? 
4. Sister -- imprisoned? wiser to the truth? 


// one son knows and the other doesnt? 
// one son was passed VAMP blood // fighter/barb/HB --- other son fighter/cleric/HB

Daughter is really young but knows truth? 


HOW DO WE EXLAIN HOW THE TOWN GOES ALONG WITH THIS? If this vamp lord has been around for 300 years why is no one aware of this? How could this possibly go unnoticed by town. 
---> 1. The Whitlocks are not actual politicians.  Meerly weatlhy long standing and influential citizens.  (LOL KINDA LIKE REAL POLITICS);
---> 2. Servants? Only a few....3-4 leit servants (1 warlock overseer) and approx 30-50 hired guards.  

OK so if Aliesters on to his....10th generation?? maybe 6th? why has no one in the town seen his other children or spouses?  


/// NEW IDEA honestly still pretty weak

Maybe this is the first time that Aliester is doing this.  Approaced by a warlockish vamp about everlasting life.  SO he sacrifices his daughter to become half vamp.  the warlock sacrifices a 100%
vamp child and he drinks the combined blood to become half vamp.  
---> mother flees? is killed? is jailed? joins him? 

The sons at the loss of their sister try to get to the bottom of her death.  Thing's don't add up and their father is acting weird so they leave and scatter out into the city.  For the regernation to 
take full effect Aliester must kill both of his sons.  Only then can he had 100 years onto his current age (49).  


/// NEW IDEA
the warlock getting Alester involved is his ANCIENT wife.  **not really sure where to go with this tbh**
