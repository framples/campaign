# Father Forgive Me -- DnD Campaign #

## Purpose: ##

    The purpose of this project is purely for fun.  I am going to be a dungeon master for 
    the first time in the next few months for a one-shot campaign with some friends.  I thought why not make a website with several things included on it to help give my players information in regards to the campaign.  It's a chance for me to design something fun and practical.  
    <br>

### General Terminology: ###
1._"DnD"_ = Dungeons and Dragons

2._"One-Shot"_ = A game of DnD meant to end quickly.  Campaigns can stretch long periods of time - a one-shot is a rapid game that usually ends in one session.  A fast paced, highly fun and intense game. 


### MVP: ###
<br>
    A simple, clean site used to help build excitement for friends for a one-shot campaign of Dungeons and Dragons.  This is purely informational for the players - sometimes with one-shots things move quickly.  Players aren't familiar with the setting/characters/story etc and this should make as an easy reference and a fun tool for the players.  

 1. Put information on site
 2. Players access information while playing to make game more interactive and fun!
