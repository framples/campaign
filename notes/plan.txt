Plan:

This is to actually mapout actions to take.  Currently I'm doing things...but not really efficiently or effectively.

- Create Two Main Fights 
- Create two small Fights 
- Create NPcs 
- Write story 
- Blood Mage Homebrew
- Vampire Homebrew
- Troll Homebrew 
- Music Playlists 
- Maps 
- Non combat encounters // Fillers 
- find art 

// Site

- Design home page
- Design information page
- Design char creation page
- Design player page
- Design login page
- Design dm page
- link data to database

- Code auth system
- code litterally everything


To finish by EOD 10/27/2019: 

1. Story
2. NPCs
3. Art
4. Start designing - Colour scheme -- layout -- functionality.  At least finish Home & Information Page.
